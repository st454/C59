    <p id="hobby"> I love cricket. It is one of my favourite things to do while I am bored. Cricket is fun for me because I love running around and smacking balls. Fielding is also fun because I get to see how much I can stretch and stop the ball from going. Bowling increases my concentration and these are all the reasons why I love cricket. </p>

        I love cricket, and 2 years ago my school had a tournament. So I decided to give it a shot in the selections.
